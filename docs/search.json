    "text": "Site Description\nThe pages on this site outline the coding components of the DATA 202: Statistically Measuring and Modeling Social Justice course at Howard University, taught by me: Professor Nathan Alexander.\nThe information on this page will serve as a technical companion to our Canvas site.\nThis page will support you in our course in the following ways:\n\nThis page will help you work with data sets and complete small tasks over time.\nThis page will walk you through the measurement aspect of research questions relevant to modeling issues of social justice.\nThis page will help you integrate mathematical ideas and technical formulas into your work.\nThis page will support your use of theory in your statistical practice, and increase your ability to document reproducible code around a set of research questions.\n\nOur canvas site (click here) contains readings and is where you will submit all assignments.\nThis site should be paired with Canvas to help you complete course assignments.\nAnd just for good measure: all assignments should be turned in via Canvas.\nWhen turning in assignments on Canvas:\n\nGenerally, PDF submissions are the way to go.\nI will not download any files not uploaded to Canvas. I will only click on a clearly visible Github repository (i.e., no shortened or bit.ly links). Article citations that include DOIs are preferred.\nWe will discuss Quarto Markdown files which integrate code, formulas, and text. Quarto is actually how I created this site for our course, and it is a great way to communicate your technical ideas.\nThis is a Canvas companion site/page (I’ll use these terms interchangeably) and it will serve as your guide to completing all technical assignments.\n\n\nGiving credit\nThe below websites were used when building this course site. I am thankful for those who have provided open source resources such as these that allow others to generate new products.\n\nDuke University’s STAT 101 course site\nNoli Brazil’s Quantitative Methods in Community Research\n\n\n\nNext up: Overview\nThe overview in the next section will walk you through the technical flow of the course.\nLike this section, a preview of forthcoming topics will be included at the bottom of each page; this means that you can treat this site like a textbook that you would read in order from start to finish. Though I encourage you to explore what else is out there and make use of other resources. That said, submissions should follow the formal guidelines outlined on our syllabus, Canvas, and this site.\n\nThe syllabus provides a high-level view of the course.\nCanvas is the go-to for submissions and provides readings and assignments.\nThis course site provides technical items and code to help you complete your assignments.\n\nComing up next are the four parts of the course and an overview of the assignments for the term. Course topics are outlined in more detail and integrated into the assignment submission schedule on the next page; see you over there!",

Two things about Canvas: it has your assignments and it has your readings.\n\n\n\nThe four categories for assignments in this course are as follows:\n\nMini-projects: Labs reports.

We also want to communicate our ideas. These can be difficult tasks.\nBut I encourage you to explore and to be creative, and to take chances. Errors should mostly remind us that there is always the backspace button. Below are some general expectations to keep us all moving forward as a community:\n\n\nCommunicate early and often\nShow up to class on time\nDo not schedule other meetings during class time\nNo late work will be accepted without prior discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can return to this page to remind yourself of the four parts of our course, especially when we dive deep into specific projects. This page will remain static (it will not be updated), so use it as an archive that you can return to; start in this page position if you have questions about the schedule, procedures, expectations (above) …then assignments (next).\n\n\n\nIn the next section, we’ll start with a brief overview of assignments and dive into your first two assignments (ungraded). The HW #0 and Lab #0 assignments will serve two purposes: first, they will help introduce you to the tools we’ll use as we begin to review statistical concepts; second, they will set you up for your first graded assignment coming up in two weeks.",
