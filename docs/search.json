    "text": "This page will support you with annotated bibliography assignment. In class, we will review how to develop a single file in Markdown format (.Rmd) to produce your annotated bibliography and course papers.\n\nPurpose\nEvery research paper should include a relevant literature review. Literature reviews can help your readers understand the need for your study, outline a paper’s central thesis, and support readers in making sense of closely related results and findings. As a result, literature reviews can come in many different lengths and formats.\nDoing a literature review is similar to doing any kind of research. A literature review should identify a central question, methodology, and also report findings. One effective way to start a literature review is to create an annotated bibliography.\nPrior to starting an annotated bibliography, it is useful to develop a question that will help you explore and better understand theoretical and methodological connections.\n\n\nFraming a question\nLiterature reviews, like most research projects, can begin from a basic question.\n\nDoes income relate to the availability of resources for [a population]?\nAre years of experience for [a sample] related to their perceptions of power?\n\nOnce you have identified a suitable question, you can use keywords to find sources for an annotated bibliography. The library website can be used to search periodicals or sources like the ERIC system, and you can also utilize popular search engines that house similar works, such as Research Rabbit and Google Scholar.\n\n\nAnnotated bibliographies\nAn annotated bibliography is a list of sources about a specific research question or topic. Each source contains a short statement about the contents of the source (e.g., research paper, online article, or other scholarly and/or published works). Annotated bibliographies are not abstracts, although their length and structure may be similar.\nEach source included in an annotated bibliography should begin with an appropriate citation of the source (in APA, MLA, or Chicago style) and a brief description of the purpose and contents of the source, as well as an evaluation or reflection. The inclusion of an evaluation or reflection when summarizing a published source is one effective way to tell the difference between the abstract and the annotation.\nView samples of annotated bibliographies.",

See the syllabus for the due dates for each paper.\nSee also another document for course papers: More information for course papers\n\n\nPapers #2 through #4 all require that you do original data analysis. All papers should be written as short research reports (try to make the text clear but sound professional, though the research questions/theories may be simple) and should include the elements described below. Please give each paper a title!\nEach paper should be written as a narrative essay. In writing the essay, you should structure it by using section headings as indicated for each paper. This should not detract from the narrative form (it should read like a paper not like answers to questions in a problem set). Each theory (or graph) should be described fully in about a paragraph, and more when necessary. Describe and justify the statistical relationship involving the theoretical variables that will be examined (including the variable’s unit of analysis and “what’s the story,” in terms of why we care about the issue(s); this is a great place to insert historical work).\nInclude a graph of some kind along with your opening at the beginning. Next, describe the data that you will be using to examine the theory. Describe the data source and for any survey data used describe the sampling method. For nationally representative data on high school students, I might say something like “The 2009 HSLS longitudinal sample is a two-stage stratified random sample of the nation’s high school students collected at the school level.” This detailed information can usually be found in the codebooks for the data sets you find. Be mindful, then, that it will require that you review these files in detail as it pertains to your own variables, your own analyses, and its relation to the social issue at hand. Theory is important.\nNext, describe the specific measures you are using and how they were obtained. Comment on how well the measures fit your theoretical variables (i.e., the face validity of the measures). In the case of survey data, report the full question wordings (verbatim) and specify the response categories and report how the variables were coded and recorded. Present the frequency distributions (so your coding and treatment of “missing data” categories can be checked); if you want to comment on the frequency distributions, you should do so in no more than 2-3 sentences (we are interested more in what comes after the distribution of the members of your sample or population!). Please include all R commands that you executed for each paper, this will be done in Quarto Markdown in Week 3.\nIn your papers, specify the hypotheses for the expected relationships (correlations/regressions) of the variables and present the operational flow graph. Then report the statistical results, describing the tables, etc. and relevant statistics and any additional calculations. Describe to what extent the evidence is consistent with your hypothesis or hypotheses and lends support to your theorizing. What can you conclude about your original theory based upon your analysis? (*Note: Due to space limitations, when presenting exploratory data analysis and in presenting relationships of variables in research and writing, it is often useful to examine and to report simple tables of means or percentages to summarize bivariate relationships as well, especially when these include nominal or ordinal level (categorical) variables.

This work is ungraded, and while there is no prerequisite for this course, these problems should serve as a review and a preview of content that we’ll explore for the course. Please do not hesitate to reach out with questions.\nExercise 0.1. If an individual’s projected income is to be converted to a z-score, which of these z-scores would a “rational agent” prefer: -2.00, -1.00, 0, 1.00, or 2.00? What is a “rational agent”? Explain why the “rational agent” would prefer the z-score you selected? Cite any sources.\nExercise 0.2. What is an integer? What is the sum of the first 100 positive integers? Explain your solution. Cite any sources. Bonus points (but definitely not required for our course): write a proof of the solution.\nExercise 0.3. Have you ever heard of p-hacking? P-hacking is where a researcher conducts multiple tests and only reports the significant results from those tests. What are some main issues here?\n\n\nLab 0\nFor your first lab, you will install two software programs on your local machine: the first is base R and the second is the RStudio Integrated Development Environment, or IDE. Both programs are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must download both R and RStudio!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to complete assignments, you must download base R and RStudio to your computer.\n\n\n\nRStudio is now called Posit. When you are searching online you will begin to see language differences.\nIt can all get very confusing. In order to reduce confusion, I am requesting that you watch this short tutorial so that we’re all on the same page. I will discuss this more when we meet.\n\n\nNext up: Computing\nOn the next page, I will walk you through downloading the appropriate software for our work this term.",

    "text": "Overview\nAs noted before, the course papers all require that you do original data analysis.\nPapers should be written as short research reports (try to make the text clear but sound professional, though the research questions may be relatively simple), and they should include the elements described below in narrative form. Please give each paper a substantive title (in addition to “Paper #_“).\nEach paper should have, at minimum, four sections: Theory, Measurement, Statistical Analysis, and Conclusion.\n\n\nTheory:\nEach theory (or logic graph) should be described fully in about a paragraph or two.\nDescribe and justify the relationships involving the theoretical variables that will be examined (including what’s the unit of analysis and “what’s the story,” in terms of why we care about the issue(s); this is a great place to insert historical work). Include a graph along with this at the beginning of the paper.\n\n\nMeasurement:\nNext, describe the data that you will be using to examine the theory. Describe the data source that you are using, and for any survey data describe the sampling method. For the General Social Survey (GSS) someone could say something like “The 2012 GSS sample is a multistage area probability sample to the segment or block level. At the block level, households are enumerated and a full probability sample is drawn.” You will need to find this type of detailed information in the Data Codebooks provided on Canvas. Describe the specific measures you are using and how they were obtained. Comment on how well the measures fit your theoretical variables (i.e., the face validity of the measures). In the case of survey data, report the full question wordings (verbatim) and specify the response categories and report how the variables were coded and re-coded. Present the frequency distributions (so your coding and treatment of missing data can be checked); if you want to comment on the frequency distributions, you should do so in no more than a couple sentences. Please include all the R commands that you executed in a .qmd file, so your work can be checked (or the commands for whatever code you use in R).\n\n\nStatistical Analysis:\nSpecify the hypotheses for the expected relationships (coefficients / correlations) in the context of the specified equations and operational flow graph. Then report the statistical results, coefficients, etc. and other relevant statistics and any additional calculations required. Describe to what extent the evidence is consistent with your hypothesis or hypotheses and lends support to your theorizing.\n\n\nConclusion:\nWhat can you conclude about your original theorizing based upon your analysis? Were you on the right track? Were your findings different from what you originally theorized?",

    "text": "Site Description\nThe pages on this site outline the coding components of the DATA 202: Statistically Measuring and Modeling Social Justice course at Howard University, taught by me: Professor Nathan Alexander.\nThe information on this page will serve as a technical companion to our Canvas site.\nThis page will support you in our course in the following ways:\n\nThis page will help you work with data sets and complete small tasks over time.\nThis page will walk you through the measurement aspect of research questions relevant to modeling issues of social justice.\nThis page will help you integrate mathematical ideas and technical formulas into your work.\nThis page will support your use of theory in your statistical practice, and increase your ability to document reproducible code around a set of research questions.\n\nOur canvas site (click here) contains readings and is where you will submit all assignments.\nThis site should be paired with Canvas to help you complete course assignments.\nAnd just for good measure: all assignments should be turned in via Canvas.\nWhen turning in assignments on Canvas:\n\nGenerally, PDF submissions are the way to go.\nI will not download any files not uploaded to Canvas. I will only click on a clearly visible Github repository (i.e., no shortened or bit.ly links). Article citations that include DOIs are preferred.\nWe will discuss Quarto Markdown files which integrate code, formulas, and text. Quarto is actually how I created this site for our course, and it is a great way to communicate your technical ideas.\nThis is a Canvas companion site/page (I’ll use these terms interchangeably) and it will serve as your guide to completing all technical assignments.\n\n\nGiving credit\nThe below websites were used when building this course site. I am thankful for those who have provided open source resources such as these that allow others to generate new products.\n\nDuke University’s STAT 101 course site\nNoli Brazil’s Quantitative Methods in Community Research\n\n\n\nNext up: Overview\nThe overview in the next section will walk you through the technical flow of the course.\nLike this section, a preview of forthcoming topics will be included at the bottom of each page; this means that you can treat this site like a textbook that you would read in order from start to finish. Though I encourage you to explore what else is out there and make use of other resources. That said, submissions should follow the formal guidelines outlined on our syllabus, Canvas, and this site.\n\nThe syllabus provides a high-level view of the course.\nCanvas is the go-to for submissions and provides readings and assignments.\nThis course site provides technical items and code to help you complete your assignments.\n\nComing up next are the four parts of the course and an overview of the assignments for the term. Course topics are outlined in more detail and integrated into the assignment submission schedule on the next page; see you over there!",
