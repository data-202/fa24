The pacakge for the ANES data is located [here](https://github.com/jamesmartherus/anesr).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(devtools)
install_github("jamesmartherus/anesr")
```

A few examples on how to access data and use the pacakge are provided below:

```{r}
library(anesr)
data(package="anesr") #View a list of available datasets

data(timeseries_cum) #Load Time Series Cumulative File (1948-2016)
data(timeseries_cum_doc) #Load documentation for the Time Series Cumulative File

data(pilot_2018) #Load 2018 Pilot Study
```

View the documentation for the data. Be sure to put `echo=F` to remove the very long output.

```{r, echo=F}
timeseries_cum
timeseries_cum_doc
```

View the pilot data from 2018.

```{r}
df <- pilot_2018
df
```
